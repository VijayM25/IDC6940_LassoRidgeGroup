## Week 1 Paper 1

A predictive model, and predictors of under-five child malaria prevalence in Ghana:[@NIH]

##### How do 'Least Absolute Shrinkage and Selection Operator'(LASSO), Ridge and Elastic net regression approaches compare?

-   To understand how Lasso, Rdige and Elastic was used in prediction.

-   Particularly in features selections

-   How it affected the fitted model.

*Its yet another paper on Malaria prediction in a community, this improves and focus on 
selections of features that best fit for Machine Learning models. Malaria among childhood in Sub-Saharan Africa is one of the leading cause of under-five mortality[@Maitlan], [@Camponova].

The interesting method of approach the author handles on elaborating LASSO regression for smallest number of predictors with the smallest prediction error. If this Machine Learning model is able to predict with smallest error, will help avoid adverse outcome after childhood malaria underscores the need for early detection and identification of high-risk populations.

The tricky part is Malaria can have wide range of covariates like physical, climatic and social factors, selecting minimal predictors which will have impact on outcome is where Lasso and Ridge regression will help.

## Data collection

The author has distributed data collection from rural and urban regions with the total of 2867 children under-five, using rapid diagnostic test(RDK) kit who got infected with malaria.

With the available dataset and literature search, they narrowed down to following variables


## Predictors

-   Child age, 
-   Number of under-five children in a household, 
-   Has mosquito bed net for sleeping, 
-   Sex of household head, 
-   Sex of a household member, 
-   Dwelling sprayed against mosquito last 12 months, 
-   Household wealth, 
-   Child-anaemia status, 
-   Has electricity in HH, 
-   Has a television in the household, 
-   Place of residence, 
-   The region of residence, 
-   Number of children who slept under mosquito bed net previous night, 
-   Insecticide-treated net available in the household, 
-   Number of household members.


## Alpha selection

For LASSO, author selected an alpha value of one, while for Ridge regression, an alpha value of zero was chosen. Since the alpha values for Elastic Net fall between zero and one 
(0<α<1), author used maximum likelihood estimation to determine the optimal alpha, which was estimated to be approximately 0.4187, based on 5-fold cross-validation repeated five times using the ‘caret’ package. Additionally, we estimated the minimum lambda (corresponding to the lowest mean squared error, or MSE) for LASSO, Ridge, and Elastic Net through maximum likelihood estimation under k-fold cross-validation.


### Modeling and Results

-   Lasso was able to predict using 11 features.

-   Ridge was able to use all features.




### Conclusion

-   Among two of logistic models using features picked by LASSO and Ridge methods. The model with LASSO features used 11 features and the Ridge model used 15 features. Both of these models explained about 20% of the differences in malaria rates among children. Each model had the same accuracy score for predictions, with an area under the curve (AUROC) of 81.2%. This means the models were quite good at predicting which children might have malaria.

-   Based on the principle of parsimony, the Lasso regression is preferred because it contains the smallest number of predictors and the smallest prediction error. LASSO model (RMSE = 0.9489, SD = 0.0202) where as Ridge (RMSE = 1.0366, SD = 0.0172) where RMSE is root mean square error i.e., prediction error
